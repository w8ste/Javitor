Javitor is a Javitor text editor written in Java. I started this projects due to my interest in text editors like vim.
I choose Java since i wanted to practice it, since it is the most thought programming language in lower semesters 
at my univerity. It is still in its early stage but already has all of the utilities a very minimal text editor 
has.

### Idea
The idea behing Javitor is to create a code editor experience which reminds the user of
classic text editors, which can be found in your typical office suite. Because people, which are 
just starting out with coding, usually have used one of these before and your standard code editors can 
be intimidating for complete beginners in the coding sphere.

### TODO:
- Add multiple colors for different keywords. 
- Add more functionality to the the menu bar.
- Give buttons useful functionality or remove them.
