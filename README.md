Javitor is a Javitor text editor written in Java. I started this projects due to my interest in text editors like vim.
I choose Java since i wanted to practice it, since it is the most thought programming language in lower semesters 
at my univerity. It is still in its early stage but already has all of the utilities a very minimal text editor 
has.
